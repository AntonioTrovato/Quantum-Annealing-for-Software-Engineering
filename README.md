# Quantum-Computing-for-Software-Engineering
Companies information systems are made of differente artefact and a lot of security incidents can affect those artifact. So, every software, when is built, integrates security controls and should pass some security tests. Unluckily, perfect testing is impossible and this means that some vulnerabilities can exist in the software. In order to minimize damage, a response strategy must be applied. This project propose a quantum solution to obtain an optimal incident response process.
